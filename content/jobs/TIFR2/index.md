- Analyzed 10000 simulated 21cm signals cubes, guided by mentor Dr. Shravan Hanasoge, to explore cosmic evolution intricacies
- Attained a remarkable 97% prediction accuracy for 21cm cube's neutral fraction using 3D CNNs, validated across 2000 labeled cubes, showcasing model robustness
- Employed different statistical models to forecast cosmological parameters, yielding strong R^2 = 0.78 correlation with actual values
