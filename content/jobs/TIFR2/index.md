- Analyzed 10K simulated 21cm signals within 128^3 cubes, guided by mentor Dr. Shravan Hanasoge, to explore cosmic evolution intricacies
- Attained a remarkable 97% prediction accuracy for 21cm cube's neutral fraction, validated across 2K labeled cubes, showcasing model robustness
- Employed ANN/CNN fusion to forecast cosmological parameters, yielding strong R^2 = 0.78 correlation with actual values
